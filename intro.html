          Mouse wait is officially called Windows wait cursor,also known as busy
          cursor, which is a mouse icon status that indicates that mouse cursor
          is busy or processes are busy performing operations and set the cursor
          to the busy state [1].
          <\p>

            </div>

            <p>
              When the mouse icon changes to Windows wait
              cursor status, spinning wheel incident happens and causes users to
              wait for current mouse wait to finish before interacting with
              applications. The problem is that most mouse wait events are
              unexpected and users are not willing to wait if it lasts a longer than
              1-2 seconds. If we are able to predict the mouse wait time, users
              could terminate their processes ahead of time when they know it might
              be a long-term wait.Currently, most studies online is about fix or
              prevent mouse wait event, but there is no research conducted on the
              mouse wait time prediction, which tells users the expected mouse wait
              times.
            </p>

            <p> In our study, we will build a classification model to predict
              mouse wait by separating the wait time into three groups: 0-5 sec,
              5-10 sec, and 10+ sec. The reason we classify the time in this way is
              that were gard 0-5 sec as short wait time, 5-10 sec as medium wait
              time, and 10+ sec as long wait. Features of our model include dynamic
              system information and static system information, which will be
              introduced in the following sections. So far, as for the model,
              Decision Tree Classifier has the highest accuracy with fair model
              evaluation. </p>

    <h1>Data</h1>
    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>
      Intel® System Usage Report (SUR) collector XLSDK is a framework that
      used to collect data for this project. In the data collection process,
      we implement input libraries (IL) that collect comprehensive raw data
      from computer and then implement Analyzer TaskLibraries (ATL) to clean
      and process these raw data.
    </p>

    <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample">
      <div class="card card-body">
        <p>
          At the beginning, Intel® Energy Checker
          SDKEnergy Server (ESRV) executes IL files to collect samples every
          second. After ESRV finishes collecting data, it writes raw data into
          Database (DB) file. Next,when ATL file is executed, it reads the DB file
          and processes raw data collected from the ILs, and outputs data into log
          files corresponding to each GUID (GlobalUnique Identifier for each
          computer). In the end, log files are uploaded to online server for
          further analysis.
        </P>
        <p>
          User wait input library is a Dynamic Link Library(DLL)
          file.During the collection process, ESRV executes this file’s function
          every 0.1 second and also at any moment when user click any mouse
          button.At each iteration, User wait IL uses Windows APIGetCursorInfo and
          GetIconInfo to capture and analyze the mouse icon. GetCursorInfo returns
          the position of cursor and a handler to cursor. By inputing this handler
          to GetIconInfo, it will return the icon status of cursor.When it returns
          a Windows wait cursor, ESRV records the current time and mouse wait
          event. After ESRV finishes its collecting process, it outputs raw mouse
          wait data to DB file with variable name and variable type defined in
          User wait IL. Since samples are collecting at every 0.1 second. Any
          event less than 0.1 second can’t be detected. However, these events are
          transient and human can’t even perceive them, so missing these events
          will be of no significance. </p>
        <p>
          After recording the mouse wait event, we
          also need to know the dynamic system information when events are
          happening. It will be the best if we can collect system usage of the
          process that is responsible.However, it is hard to tract which
          application causes the mouse wait event since OS can cause a mouse wait
          at any time.Therefore, we decide to collect all processes’ system usage
          when mouse wait event happens. Besides User wait IL, we have Process
          IL.ESRV executes the Process IL to record comprehensive information of
          each process. At each iteration, It calls the Windows API
          ZwQuerySystemInformation and OpenProcess. ZwQuerySystemInformation will
          list all processes and its PID (process ID) currently running on the
          system and OpenProcess utilizes PID to collect each process’s system
          usage like process name, running time, I/O usage, memory usage, disk
          usage and page fault. Unlike User wait IL which records data only when
          it encounters spinning wheel incident event, the ProcessIL records and
          writes all data it captures every second. </p>

        <p>After the raw data is collected
          and saved as raw DB file, analyzer tasks read the file and analyze them
          by language C and SQL. Since all measurements by ILs are timestamped,
          the start time (ts) of a mouse wait event is the timestamp of the first
          row of that mouse wait event.The duration (waitmsec) of the mouse wait
          event is the timestamp difference between the first row and last row of
          that mouse wait event. By using the ts of mouse wait event, ATL can
          locate the processes in plist data set that has the same ts, which are
          running processes during mouse wait event, and compute CPU-util,
          Disk-Util,Network-util and Hard Page Fault. These features will be saved
          as mousewaitall log file. In the file, each row denotes a mouse wait
          event and each column denotes system usage related to one mouse wait
          event.

        <p>
          At the beginning, we implement our own XLSDK and ATLASK and do the data
          collection on local computers, but then we realize the scale of data
          sets is too small and may cause the model has high bias. We need more
          data from all kinds of users. Since we don’t have resource to access
          such many users, Intel team collect and provide us with data sets. Data
          sets includes 14,534,433 rows with 29,587 unique GUID within the 2020
          interval. Since the complete dataset is fairly large, we choose all rows
          within 2020 October interval as train set and choose all rows within
          next month, 2020 November, as test set for our model. In the train
          set,there are 1,729,282 rows and 16,778 distinct GUID. In the test set,
          there are 1,488,682 rows and 15,702 distinctGuid. For the target feature
          waitmsecs, we divide the wait time into 0-5s, 5-10s and 10+s as a
          preparation for the classification model. After exploring the
          correlation between potential features and the mouse wait time, we find
          that dynamic features, including CPU utilization,disk utilization, hard
          page faults, and static features,including the number of cores, RAM,
          model type, etc,could influence the mouse wait time. These features are
          then incorporated in the model.
